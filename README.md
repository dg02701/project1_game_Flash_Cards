REQUIREMENTS
Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly (back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!

Bonus:

Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)

User Interviews:
Interviewed two homeschooling moms.  Recieved feedback on keys selected for gameplay.  KeyA to show the answer was preferred over KeyF (for 'Flip).  This was even if graphics were put on to visually flip the flashcards.
